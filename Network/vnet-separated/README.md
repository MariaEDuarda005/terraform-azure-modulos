## **Overview**
This module provisions an **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)** with support for custom address spaces, DNS settings, and multiple subnets. It enables private and secure communication between Azure resources, forming the core of a cloud-based network topology.

> The **Virtual Network** service in Azure allows you to define and control your private network in the cloud, similar to a traditional on-premises network, with full IP address control, DNS integration, and subnet configuration.

## **Stack**

- **Infrastructure Manager:** Terraform
- **Provider:** `azurerm` (Azure Provider)
- **Network Type:** IPv4 private address space with optional custom DNS
- **Subnet Support:** Multiple subnet blocks

## **Settings**

### **Virtual Network**

- **address_space**

  - **Definition:** The address space allocated to the virtual network in CIDR notation.
  - **Used:** ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  - **Available:** One or more IPv4 ranges, e.g., `["10.0.0.0/16"]`. Must not overlap with other VNets in the same region or peered networks.

- **dns_servers**

  - **Definition:** Custom DNS server IP addresses to be used by resources in the VNet.
  - **Used:** ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
  - **Available:** A list of valid IPv4 addresses. If omitted, Azureâ€™s default DNS is used.

### **Subnet**

- **name_subnet**

  - **Definition:** The name of the subnet within the Virtual Network.
  - **Used:** internal-dev
  - **Available:** Any valid name that is unique within the VNet.

- **address_prefixes**

  - **Definition:** CIDR block(s) for the subnet.
  - **Used:** ["10.0.1.0/24"]
  - **Available:** Must be a valid subnet of the VNet's `address_space`. Cannot overlap with other subnets.
